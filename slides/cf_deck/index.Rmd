## A little bit about me:

* I am a researcher specializing in data analytics and R programming
* I also code in: GAMS, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and, MySQL <br>
* I've always had a passion to learn and discover new skills
* I assembled my first computer from stock parts in 2000
* In 2009, I began writing scripts in Stata, at UBC (Stata is data analysis software)
* In 2012, almost a year after graduation from UBC, a former professor e-mailed me and
  asked me to do research assistance. It must have been those essays I wrote (needless to
  say at that time they were my best work)

## A little bit about me:

* I would spend the next 3 years working on a number of code intensive projects
* I learned a lot about data in those three years!

## Data now and tomorrow:

* It was during that 3 year period, putting the big hours into data coding, that I began looking at the fast
  changing global technological landscape


* ### OUR WORLD WAS CHANGING AND IT WAS CHANGING FAST!

* ### GUESS WHAT?

## Data now and tomorrow:

* ### IT'S  STILL CHANGING

* You can't see it, but demand for data analytics is growing at a lightning pace, and it's
only getting started

## Demand for data analytics:

* Demand for data analytics is growing because data collection is skyrocketing
* It's growing so fast you can now hear people saying, "In the next few months we will
  gather more information than all the existing information combined"
* According to Eric Schmidt, something like 2.5 exabytes of data, .33 gigs/person, is
  generated globally every day by people and machines
* By this estimate, the Canadian population is on average responsible for 10 million gigs
  of new data/day.
* That's 10,000 100 gig laptops of data, every day!

## Demand for data analytics:

* According to McKinsey Global Institute, by 2018, the U.S. alone will face a shortage of
  about 190,000 data scientists, and 1.5 million analysts and managers that 'get' big data

* The ICTC (Information and Communications Technology Council) reports Canada will need
  182,000 people to fill IT positions by 2019. Those positions with the highest demand (nonordinal):
    * Information systems analysts and consultants
    * Computer and network operators and web technicians
    * **Computer programmers and interactive media developers**
    * Software engineers
    * Graphic designers and illustrators
    * Computer and information systems managers
    * **Database analysts and data administrators**

* ### NONLOCAL DEMAND:

* There are a lot more nonlocal companies working with data
    * Clean Energy Canada outsources all of the services we are offering
    * Visual Capitalist is currently doing in house data collection but potentially
     looking outside for that service

* ### LOCAL COMPETITION

* There are no remote data analysts in Nelson offering data analytics services

* Data analytics are right now in big demand, and will be even more so in coming years
* Tricys Consulting has the skills and experience to perform in demand data analytics services
* There is so far evidence of both local and external demand for remote data analytics services
* Going into the data analytics business as a self-employed data analyst makes sense, right now
